# Tracking Pomodoro Study Time

The R file contains the code to transform data exported from the popular clockwork tomato app for IOS and Android. The typical logs.csv file can be exported from the app under the share icon. The data (mostly including timestamps) is transformed into datapoints representing hours studied every seven days. This is consistent with how data in the app is represented.
